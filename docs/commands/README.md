# Sequential AI Prompt Workflow

This section outlines the recommended sequential workflow for using your AI prompts. Each step builds on the previous one to ensure clarity, maintain context, and produce actionable outputs. Follow the order below for best results.

---

## 1. Run create_brief prompt

**Purpose:** Establish the high-level context of your project. This provides grounding for all subsequent planning and implementation.

**Example:**
```text
@create_brief.md

"We are building..."
```

---

## 2. Run plan_feature prompt

**Purpose:** Generate a focused technical plan for a new feature. Focus on the implementation approach rather than product context or detailed code.

**Example:**

```text
@plan_feature.md

"We want to add a new feature..."
```

---

## 3. Run plan prompt that was generated by the previous prompt

**Purpose:** Implement the plan that was output from step 2. This step should be mechanical and faithful to the generated plan.

**Example:**

```text
Please implement 1_PLAN.md
```

---

## 4. Open new chat for unbiased context and run the code_review prompt

**Purpose:** Review the implementation in a clean context to catch errors, inconsistencies, or edge cases. This helps remove confirmation bias from the review process.

**Example:**

```text
@code_review.md
@1_PLAN.md
```

---

## 5. Address the output of the previous prompt and instruct it according to your description

**Purpose:** Fix issues identified during the code review. This closes the loop and ensures the implementation aligns with the plan and rules.

**Example:**

```text
"Please implement fixes for all the issues found"
```

This keeps all of your original examples intact and simply adds one-line context for each step.
